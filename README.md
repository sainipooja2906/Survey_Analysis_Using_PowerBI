This project analyzes survey responses from data professionals across various countries and job roles. Using Python (Pandas), the dataset was cleaned and explored to identify patterns in salary distribution, experience levels, favorite tools, and job satisfaction. An interactive Power BI dashboard was created to visualize these insights and highlight key industry trends.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
